ARXH:
	LDA 2000H ;we load the input to the accumulator
	CPI C7H ; we compare it with 199 and if it larger than that	
	JNC CASE_1 ; we jump into the first case handling
	CPI 63H ; if it is not then we check if it is greater than 99
	JNC CASE_2 ; if it is we jump in the second case
	MVI B,FFH ; else we have the third case where the number is <99
DECA:
	INR B ; the assembly code is the same with the problem in page 84
	SUI 0AH ; but the only difference is that we save the units
	JNC DECA ; and tens in the same register
	ADI 0AH ; to do so we save the units into reg C
	MOV C,A ; and the tens to Accumulator like done in the next command
	MOV A,B ; Then in order to have them in the MSBs we shift them
	RLC ; four times to the left 
	RLC
	RLC
	RLC
	ADD C ; and then add the units
	CMA ; we have the complement of A beacuse the LEDS are of negative logic
	STA 3000H ; we save the result and then we jump into the ARXH
	JMP ARXH

CASE_1:
	MVI A,FFH ; we set all the LEDS and we complement them to be properly shown
	CMA
	STA 3000H
	JMP ARXH
CASE_2:
	SUI 64H ; we remove 100 from the final result
	CMA
	STA 3000H
	JMP ARXH
